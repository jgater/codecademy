#Codecademy work in progress

##About

This repo contains my educational and testing files for the Codecademy code year in Javascript. They do not make up
a single cohesive system, though files within a folder are usually associated with a particular project.

Development work occurs in the development branch, while master is reserved for functional, working-as-intended code.
